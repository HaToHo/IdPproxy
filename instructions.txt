To use this proxy you have to do the following:

Let's assume the you want to use Facebook as an authenticator/identity provider.
How you do other social media is roughly equal.

First you have to get a client id/client secret pair.
To be able to do this you have to have a user at Facebook.
I think it's a good idea to create a special new user for this and not
reuse your own private.

This webside is a pretty good introduction on how to do the registration
for some different social media.

Doing the registration the return address (redirect/callback URI/domain) has
to be registered. For this you should use:

https://idp-test.social2saml.org:8090/<social>

That is if you register with Facebook, the redirect URI must be:

http://idp-test.social2saml.org:8090/facebook/

When you've got the id/secret pair you must create a file with the format:

{
   "Facebook": {
      "key": "hallon",
      "secret": "bbbbb"},
}

This processing below has to be done manually right now.
Better support will appear in the future.

$ git clone https://github.com/rohe/pyjwkest.git
$ cd pyjwkest
$ python setup.py install

Assuming that the file you created above is named 's2s.txt'

$ cat <s2s.txt> | jwenc.py -J <URL> -a 'RSA-OAEP' -e 'A128CBC+HS256' - > s2s.jwe

<URL> = http://idp-test.social2saml.org/idptest.jwk

The resulting file 's2s.jwe' can be mailed to me.
In the same mail you should state which SPs that should be allowed to use your
registration.

When I know which social medias you want to use, I'll provide you with an
URL where you can fetch the metadata.

The eppn you will get are of the form:

<uid>@<social>.social2saml.org
